# Solar-System-using-Unity
Made our solar system using Unity

The goal for this project is to construct an orrery of the solar system in Unity. The orrery will show the 
planets in the solar system and their orbits/rotations.

The purpose of this project is to experiment with transforms, combining transforms together in 
GameObject hierarchies and the use of Scripts in Unity.
